## Data

The contents of Table 1 were extracted by [Peggy Xirogiannopoulou](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pegxirog86) and [Dominic Fawcett](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/dominic-fawcett/42/1b/825) as part of their MSc project for my Phyloinformatics course. They created a Google Fusion table https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?snapid=S1594901zBi1 I have exported this data to a CSV file.
